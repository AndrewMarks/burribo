# Phase 6: Blog - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A mixed-format blog that handles both long-form essays and shorter updates. The reading experience should feel cohesive with the portfolio — using the VALORANT-inspired dark theme and geometric accents — but toned down for comfortable reading. Bold headers and design elements are fine, but the content needs room to breathe.

When someone lands on a post, they should be able to read without distraction. The design supports the writing, not the other way around.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Reading experience** — Typography, spacing, and flow must be comfortable for long-form reading. Good line lengths, proper font sizing, generous whitespace.
- **Mixed content support** — Should handle both essays and shorter dev log style posts without feeling awkward for either.

## What's Out of Scope

- Comments and social interaction — No Disqus, no reactions, just static content
- Complex categorization — If tags/categories happen, keep it simple

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Focus on typography fundamentals — readable fonts, comfortable line lengths, solid spacing
- Toned-down portfolio aesthetic — cohesive but readable
- No specific reference sites — trust the design system

## Additional Context

The blog is flexible content format but reading comfort is the priority. Better to have a simple, readable blog than a feature-rich but cluttered one.
