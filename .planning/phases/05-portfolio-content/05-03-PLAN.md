<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Finalize Quailworks content</name>
  <files>portfolio/quailworks.md</files>
  <action>
Update portfolio/quailworks.md with polished content:

1. Front matter (keep existing):
   - layout: portfolio-company
   - title: Quailworks
   - tagline: Performance marketing consultancy for games
   - external_url: https://quailworks.com/
   - external_cta: Visit Quailworks

2. Content: Keep minimal per UAT feedback (hero + brief description). The current simplified content from 04-FIX is appropriate. Just verify it reads well and is production-ready.

3. Consider adding:
   - One compelling sentence about what Quailworks does
   - Brief value proposition
   - Keep it minimal — the CTA drives to external site

Do NOT add back the structured About/Services sections (removed during UAT fix).
