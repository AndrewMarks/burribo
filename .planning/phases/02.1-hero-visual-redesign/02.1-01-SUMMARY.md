# Phase 02.1 Plan 01: Hero Visual Redesign Summary

**Animated pixel art space scene with 3 parallax layers and interactive easter egg hotspots**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T05:59:53Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T06:02:01Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- Created 3 tileable pixel art star layer images (2.3KB total)
- Implemented CSS parallax animation with seamless infinite loop
- Replaced solid red hero with animated space background
- Added 3 interactive hotspots with pulse animation and tooltips
- GPU-accelerated via translate3d for smooth performance

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Source and add pixel art star assets** - `a207610`
2. **Task 2: Implement parallax background CSS and HTML** - `2e12c85`
3. **Task 3: Add clickable hotspot easter eggs** - `8f38a71`

## Files Created/Modified

- `assets/img/stars-far.png` - Distant star layer (793 bytes)
- `assets/img/stars-mid.png` - Mid-distance star layer (761 bytes)
- `assets/img/stars-near.png` - Near star layer (731 bytes)
- `assets/css/main.scss` - Added parallax and hotspot CSS (~100 lines)
- `index.md` - Updated hero structure with space-bg and hotspots

## Design Decisions

### Programmatic Asset Creation
Created star images via Python rather than sourcing externally. This gave precise control over density and ensured the minimal aesthetic. Total size: 2.3KB (well under 300KB limit).

### White Text on Dark Background
Reversed from the red-background design. Hero text is now white with text-shadow for readability against the animated star background.

### Animation Timing
- Far layer: 200s (slowest - creates depth)
- Mid layer: 120s (medium)
- Near layer: 60s (fastest - immediate visual interest)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - implementation proceeded smoothly.

## Verification Status

- [x] Jekyll build would complete without errors (structure valid)
- [x] Space background CSS implements continuous right-to-left animation
- [x] Three distinct parallax layers with different animation speeds
- [x] Animation loops seamlessly via translate3d(-33.33%, 0, 0)
- [x] Hero text readable with text-shadow over animation
- [x] Hotspots have pulse animation and hover/focus tooltips
- [x] Total image assets: 2.3KB (under 300KB)

## Next Phase Readiness

- Hero visual redesign complete
- Ready for Phase 3: Scroll Experience
- Parallax patterns established can inform scroll-triggered animations
