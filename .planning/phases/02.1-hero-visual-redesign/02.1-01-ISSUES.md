## Open Issues

### UAT-001: Hero animation doesn't scale properly on mobile viewports

**Discovered:** 2026-02-02
**Phase/Plan:** 02.1-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Parallax space background
**Description:** Animation doesn't fit properly on narrow/mobile viewport widths. The parallax background scaling is designed for desktop.
**Expected:** Animation should scale or adapt to mobile viewports
**Actual:** Animation has scaling issues on narrow screens

**Note:** This was intentionally deferred per 02.1-CONTEXT.md:
> "Full mobile optimization - Desktop-first, mobile can be simplified in Phase 7"

**Recommended action:** Address in Phase 7 (Polish & Deploy) as originally planned.

## Resolved Issues

### UAT-002: Star images not loading (baseurl issue)

**Discovered:** 2026-02-02 during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 02.1-01
**Severity:** Major (blocking)
**Description:** Star images weren't visible - showed only dark background
**Cause:** Image paths in CSS didn't include Jekyll baseurl (/burribo)
**Resolved:** 2026-02-02 - Fixed by adding $baseurl SCSS variable
