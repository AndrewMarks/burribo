This is the start of something new. A space for longer thoughts that don't fit neatly into project descriptions or portfolio pieces.

Expect a mix of content here. Some posts will be essays exploring design decisions and creative process. Others will be shorter updates on what I'm working on. The format is intentionally flexible because different ideas need different room to breathe.

## What to Expect

The plan is to write when there's something worth sharing. No arbitrary publishing schedule, no filler content. Just genuine thoughts on the work.

Topics will likely orbit around design, development, and the intersection of the two. How tools shape thinking. Why certain approaches work better than others. The messy reality behind polished portfolio pieces.

If that sounds interesting, stick around. There's more to come.
